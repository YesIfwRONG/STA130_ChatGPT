Hey I didn't quite understand survivorship bias during the class, could you kindly explain this all to me?

Sure, I'd be happy to explain survivorship bias to you!

### Survivorship Bias

**Definition:** Survivorship bias is a logical error that occurs when we concentrate on the people or things that have "survived" some process while overlooking those that did not because they are no longer visible or included in the data. This bias can lead to false conclusions in various fields, including business, economics, and even everyday decision-making.

### Example Scenario

**Scenario:** Imagine you're analyzing the success rates of businesses based on the advice of successful entrepreneurs.

**Survivorship Bias in Action:** You only study businesses that have thrived and are still operating. You collect data on their strategies and attributes. However, you ignore businesses that failed and are no longer in existence.

**Real-Life Implications:** By focusing only on successful businesses, you might falsely conclude that certain strategies or traits (like aggressive risk-taking or specific marketing tactics) are guaranteed paths to success. In reality, many businesses that followed the same advice might have failed, but their stories are not considered because they didn't survive.

### Key Takeaways

Survivorship bias can distort our understanding by:

- **Overestimating success:** By focusing only on successful examples, we may overlook the risks and failures that are part of the broader picture.
- **Misguiding decision-making:** Advice or strategies based on survivorship bias may not be applicable to all situations because they ignore the failures that could have provided crucial insights.

In research, business analysis, or any field where data on outcomes is gathered, it's essential to consider both the successes and failures to get a complete and accurate understanding. This approach helps avoid drawing misleading conclusions that can lead to poor decisions or strategies.

Now use Spotify songs as an example

#### Survivorship Bias in Spotify Songs

**Scenario:** You're interested in analyzing the characteristics of successful songs on Spotify to understand what makes them popular.

**Survivorship Bias in Action:** You decide to study only the top-charting songs on Spotifyâ€”those with millions of streams and high rankings. You collect data on their genres, tempo, lyrics, and artist characteristics.

**Real-Life Implications:** By focusing exclusively on successful songs, you might conclude that upbeat pop songs with catchy hooks and certain lyrical themes (such as love or empowerment) are the key to success on Spotify. However, this overlooks the numerous songs that didn't achieve popularity despite having similar characteristics. These songs might have been equally well-produced but failed to attract listeners for various reasons like timing, promotion, or sheer luck.

#### Key Takeaways

- **Overestimating success factors:** You might mistakenly believe that specific musical elements or marketing strategies are universally effective for achieving success on Spotify.
- **Incomplete understanding:** Ignoring less successful songs prevents you from understanding the broader range of factors that influence song popularity.
- **Implications for decision-making:** Artists or producers relying solely on data from successful songs might make decisions that don't account for the diversity of listener preferences and market dynamics.

To avoid survivorship bias in music analysis, it's crucial to consider a diverse dataset that includes both successful and less successful songs. This approach provides a more balanced view of what contributes to song popularity and helps in making informed decisions regarding music production, marketing strategies, and artist development.
